  - non existing user says user not found ![screenshot of user not found](screenshots/usernotfound.png)
  - after 30 minutes of inactivity, the site will return to login in page
  - After learning more about the login system, we managed to get ahead and implement our login right away (instead of waiting for the next homework deadline).
- Classes & Inheritance around 70% done
  - There were a few modification with our classes, outside of the clothing, closet, and generator classes, we concluded that we needed to implemented a few child classes that inherit from the clothing classes, that is a bottom class, top class, onepiece class, and sweater class. We decided this was necessary because having these classes will help us differentiate between different type of clothing.
  - Classes we have done so far:
    - Clothing Class: has get method to return information (type, color, temp, pattern, occasion, file tile)
- need to test SQL tables in PHP
  - users table is functional for sign in
