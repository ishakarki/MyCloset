# MyCloset
Project for CSCI 3010.

This project is a website that allows users to essentially have their entirety of 
their closet all in one place. Based on a user's input of occasion or weather, our program will
find a relevant outfit for the user from the clothes in their closet. 

This project will heavily rely on PHP to act as the front end, back end, and integration layer. We intend to
use HTML/CSS for the front-end from PHP, as well as use SQL for the database.
